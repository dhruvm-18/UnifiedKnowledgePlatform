Here's what I found regarding a Data Principal's right to withdraw consent:\n\nYes, a **Data Principal** has the right to **withdraw her consent at any time**. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, specifically mandates that the **ease of withdrawing consent** must be **__comparable__** to the ease with which the consent was initially given.\n\nHowever, the **consequences** of such withdrawal shall be **borne by the Data Principal**, and the withdrawal does **not affect the legality of processing** personal data that occurred based on consent *before* its withdrawal.\n\n*   **Right to Withdraw Consent**: A Data Principal can withdraw consent at any time.\n    *   **Ease of Withdrawal**: The ease of withdrawing consent must be comparable to the ease with which it was given.\n*   **Implications of Withdrawal**:\n    *   The Data Principal bears the consequences of withdrawal.\n    *   Withdrawal does not affect the legality of processing performed before the withdrawal.\n\n**Sources**:\n*   **Section 6(4)** (pdf://DPDP_act.pdf/page/5#section=Section_6)\n*   **Section 6(5)** (pdf://DPDP_act.pdf/page/5#section=Section_6)\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any more questions!",
