These algorithms offer compact keys suitable for limited bandwidth, robust semantic security, and compatibility with hybrid encryption frameworks for phased implementation.\n*   Fostering **cooperation** among cryptographers, aerospace engineers, and legislators to integrate PQC into space communication protocols before quantum threats emerge.\n\n**Sources**\n*   **[5.3 Impact and Lessons Learned]** (pdf://ISS_Report.docx/page/5.3#section=Impact and Lessons Learned)\n*   **[5.5 Future Implications and Relevance to PQC]** (pdf://ISS_Report.docx/page/5.5#section=Future Implications and Relevance to PQC)\n*   **[6 Conclusion]** (pdf://ISS_Report.docx/page/6#section=Conclusion)\n\nFeel free to ask if you have more questions.",
