 One of our favorite tools for helping people with their side hustles make money online is Perplexity AI. This is a very big company. I would say probably like when you talk about the top AI companies It's top 20 for sure. Maybe top to probably top 10 if you look at It's hard to say because there's so many big companies like Apple Google Amazon that all have stuff And there's different billions of dollars on them So it's hard to compete with those that are in the kind of the top 10 but like startups that actually came into the space Perplexity is definitely the top 10 startups like it's it's what it's way up there with Chat GBT and Anthropic and they have just dropped a massive new update Which is essentially creating a new tier a $200 a month tier so today on the podcast we're gonna break down What exactly you get with this $200 a month tier if it's worth it if Jamie and I will be getting it Some of the features that we think are particularly interesting for online side hustles What we might be using it for what we've used perplexity for in the past all of that good stuff But before we do I wanted to mention that if you've ever wanted to grow and scale your own business using AI tools We'd love to have you as a member of the AI hustle school community This is something Jamie and I do every single week We essentially talk about how we're using AI to make money online different side hustles that we're doing and how we're using AI to grow and scale our businesses and careers This week we did a whole deep dive on something called the Amazon influencer program and it's essentially a way that you can get You get paid a commission if you generate if you make videos about any sort of product in your house And we talked a whole bunch about how you can actually get free stuff. Jamie got a free couch those a thousand dollars from this So there's a whole bunch of really interesting things there and we break down a whole video if that's interesting to you if not we have Over 50 videos talking about different tools we use for online marketing to grow and scale businesses and a ton of other interesting stuff It's $19 a month and the link is in the description We'd love to have you as a member of the AI hustle school community. All right, Jamie Tell me what was most interesting to you about perplexity and their new $200 a month subscription plan is that too expensive or is it worth the money? Yeah, I mean, I you know that first, you know when you read that $200 price point that kind of makes you like choke a little bit It seems super expensive, you know what value could they possibly add? That would be worth it, but I really I'm gonna read off some of the different features and I really think there is a lot of potential here And I'm gonna talk about why in a minute, but they're offering Access to their spreadsheet and report generation tool Labs, which is also like kind of along the similar I think maybe that is what labs is And then they also have a new AI powered browser that they're releasing which I'm super excited about called it's called comment And they're also gonna give you priority access to Services using their latest models such as open a eyes 03 pro and clawed open four so they're kind of including a lot But I think you know that first one to me be able to generate spreadsheets and reports I think perplexe could really knock it out of the park with I feel like You know sometimes I'll have chat GBT make me a spreadsheet and it's not like fully functional or not really like That good even even still, you know, they're not but perplexity I feel like has always had really great graphics Really great research and you know on in the you know up-to-date statistics and things like that So I feel like they could really lean into this and actually have a really powerful Report generation tools. So I'm pretty excited about that. But what do you are reading about here, Jinn? Okay, sorry I'm like let's get into those because I think those tools are probably actually the big headline here But just the thread I want to pull on for a second that I do think is really interesting is their new browser So they haven't explicitly like said what it is they have a wait list if you go to perplexity.ai slash comment It says a browser for agentic search by perplexity and something that was interesting that they said One of their spokespeople said quote just like perplexity reinvented search were also reinventing the browser Something that I think is interesting here. Well, so first off. Well, that's very intriguing to see what an actual browser would look like I think that the the thing that's interesting is they really did reinvent search like they Forced Google to completely change the way they did search if you look at what Google is doing with you know AI search today It's largely a response to perplexity like you could say it's a response to chat to you That's probably like a portion of it But honestly like perplexity is the one that I think is really crushing and if perplexity has a competitive advantage that Google can't really compete with this pretty tricky and that is the fact that perplexity allows you to access all of the AI models on Their platform to power your search. So like Google they've got Gemini 2.5 pro which right now is actually great I think it's one of the top of the line and I models it just came out as one of the newest so yes, it's the best Or one of the best it's on par with the best but If opening that comes out with a killer model or Groc comes out with a killer model from XAI Or anthropic comes out with a killer model that beats it Maybe Google's like scrambling to try to catch up for a month or two Do you really want to use like the second best model for a couple months while you're waiting for Google to get around and try to make their search a little bit better? I think perplexity has a really big competitive advantage in the fact that you can switch between models It's kind of like what I'm doing with my startup AI box.ai where I let you chat with you know over 40 different models You could switch them out. There's new models all the time different models are better than others And it's the same kind of concept We're not really like a search engine like perplexity is we're more for like what you'd use chat you put you for tasks and and kind of building documents and Workflows and stuff and we do audio and video and or sorry audio and image and stuff All kind of in the same chat, but it's the same concept and I think that this is a competitive advantage So when it comes to building an actual browser, I think perplexity If they you know come up with something incredible new and creative I think they need a lot of market share But I also would expect Google Chrome and probably Microsoft and everyone else that has a browser already to copy them if they have a great idea Which I think they probably do so is this new browser good enough to spend $200 a month on The only precedent that I see in the AI industry right now that is charging $200 a month. There's two things number one is Google's video video generator that's like you know, it's obviously super expensive to generate videos And number two is chat should be operator and through offic has kind of a version of that and Google has sort of a version of that but really I feel like If they're charging $200 a month, they better be doing something like chat should be operator where it's completely doing something now that's where That's where I think they're probably going with this new browser with their comment browser It's probably going to be a lot like chat should be operator where I actually can complete tasks for you It says a browser for agentic search So you would assume agentic search means actually accomplishing things for you And if that's the case, it's probably worth $200 if it's as good as chat should be operator No, that's a great point. Yeah, if it can include some of those Yeah, agentic features like you said, or it's doing stuff for you I think you know, I think this is really going to be something that companies use If you think of you know, is this similar to what chat should be teased doing with their operator? It's gonna it's gonna replace employees eventually, you know, and that's an unfortunate You know consequence of all this but I feel like with the spreadsheets and reports This could be kind of their lane that they're they're using as well like You know creating a company's profit and loss sheet and graphs at the end of the year showing like here's where our money's going And being able to do all that with AI Even on a you know weekly or daily basis There's really powerful and it could replace like an entire position really at a company. So I feel like That if it's good, which I'm assuming it is the spreadsheet and report generation tool will be really powerful for corporations Yeah, so I think it's gonna be good They that whole thing that they that they have is called Proplexity labs they do a bunch of really cool things in there I think it's them trying to differentiate themselves and build like an interesting new tool kind of like how chat should be has their GPT's They have their canvas that can open up when you're talking and it's building a document like so all these AM models beyond just a powerful LLM are trying to create like software around it This is where Proplex is excelled because they traditionally leaned on other LLMs And so yeah, I think this is gonna be interesting is it worth $200 a month? I don't know if it is today like I don't think I would pay $200 today personally for this Because if you go to like their payment page And you go to their you know, they're $200 or they're like their payments. They have a $20 a month plan Which is it says 10 times as many citations and the answers. Okay, that's great Right, so like versus a free perplexity thing it has all these citations So it's pretty much fact checking everything and linking it back to sources, which is really good You get the perplexity labs, which is good. It's kind of like their deep research and it builds powerful documents and reports and stuff like that Also perplexity research, so I guess that's more like their deep research Unlimited file and video uploads are sorry on photo uploads This is kind of interesting because obviously that all costs a lot of money. They got to store that Extended access to image generation. They're you know, they have APIs to some of these image generators And then you know everything else that you kind of expect so that's a $20 a month And I think that's got a lot of value to it I think you know if you're if you're interested in using a lot of AI models for search and stuff Definitely pay $20 a month for perplexity then on their $200 model They say early access to comment the agentic browser if it's just like Google Chrome like Like whatever like why would I want early access to this but if it's Chat GPD operator yes, but when it says early access I don't know if that means that you get it today or if it's coming like early access whenever it comes out So I would clarify that and then unlimited access to perplexity labs again You're already getting this for the $20 a month. I don't know how much more unlimited gets you or how crazy people get with that um, and then you can use the advanced models like o3 pro Opus you know four or whatever so like those are useful, but you could also just go pay $20 a month on Claude or open AI and get access to those so I don't know if I pay the 200 for those you know what I mean It's kind of hard to upsell something that costs $20 somewhere else for 200 So I think their big play here is their browser and I think it's gonna be a chat a A chat GPD operator competitor But until it's like fully launched. I'm watching YouTube videos about how good it is I personally want to pay the $200 so do you think right now? It's kind of more just like fanboys who love perplexity who are gonna be signing up for it or or Do you think people actually use the features enough to make it worth 200? I Don't know who is maybe maybe yeah, maybe if you really will if you're a power user of per Proplexity then you'll sign up they're not gonna get a lot of signups until the until their browser actually launches and people find out if it's actually good or not If it is good this thing will fly like hotcakes because if it's like if it's a brat if it's an agent Browser that's really really valuable you can get a ton of work done you can make money with it It's like very easy to Justify that until it launches. I think not a lot of people will probably sign up for it Totally, but anyways, so perplexity up until this point generated 34 million dollars in revenue in 2024 and that's largely driven by their Pro plans. So that's that's a pretty decent chunk of change, but they still burned 65 million in cash it says so they're still operating at a loss. So You know, maybe this is an attempt of them to kind of boost some of that revenue Not really sure, but I still I still am optimistic about about what they have and I'm excited to see what the comment browser has has to offer Yeah, same same very very excited. I'm pumped about anyone pushing forward the New features and exciting stuff in AI.
