It is a mechanism under GST that allows a registered person to utilize the tax paid on their inward supplies (purchases of goods or services) as a set-off against their output tax liability, thus making the tax **__vatable__** and avoiding a cascading tax effect. The amount available in the electronic credit ledger can be used for making payments towards output tax.\n\n**Sources**\n*   **[(63) \u201cinput tax credit\u201d means the credit of input tax;]** (pdf://CGST.pdf/page/15#section=(63) \u201cinput tax credit\u201d means the credit of input tax;)\n*   **[(4) The amount available in the electronic credit ledger may be used for making any payment towards output tax under this Act or under the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act in such manner and subject to such conditions and restrictions and within such time as may be prescribed.]** (pdf://CGST.pdf/page/51#section=(4) The amount available in the electronic credit ledger may be used for making any payment towards output tax under this Act or under the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act in such manner and subject to such conditions 3[and restrictions] and within such time as may be prescribed.)\n*   **[3.

Besides being vatable, the rate of tax for the integrated goods and services tax is proposed to be more or less equal to the sum total of the central goods and services tax and state goods and services tax or Union territory goods and services tax to be levied on intra -State supplies.
