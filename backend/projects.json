It is a mechanism under GST that allows a registered person to utilize the tax paid on their inward supplies (purchases of goods or services) as a set-off against their output tax liability, thus making the tax **__vatable__** and avoiding a cascading tax effect.

Besides being vatable, the rate of tax for the integrated goods and services tax is proposed to be more or less equal to the sum total of the central goods and services tax and state goods and services tax or Union territory goods and services tax to be levied on intra -State supplies.
